# TODO: Implement Document Types Pages and Fix Documents Sidebar Menu

## Context

The user has requested two main tasks:
1. Ensure the "Document Types" pages are implemented professionally following the same structure as other table pages
2. Investigate and fix why the "Documents" page is not appearing in the "Document Management" sidebar menu

### Current Status Analysis:

**Document Types Implementation:**
-  Convex schema exists in `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/convex/schema.ts`
-  Convex CRUD operations exist in `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/convex/documentTypes.ts`
-  Table component exists at `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/components/document-types/document-types-table.tsx`
-  Form dialog exists at `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/components/document-types/document-type-form-dialog.tsx`
-  Page component exists at `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/document-types/page.tsx`
-  i18n translations exist in both `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/messages/en.json` and `pt.json`
-  Sidebar menu entry exists (showing in "Document Management" section)

**Documents Page Issue:**
-  Documents table component exists at `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/components/documents/documents-table.tsx`
-  Documents page exists at `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/documents/page.tsx`
- L **MISSING** from sidebar menu in `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/components/app-sidebar.tsx`
- L Route file `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/documents/new/page.tsx` exists but may need investigation

## Task Sequence

### 0. Project Structure Analysis

**Objective**: Understand the project structure and confirm correct file/folder locations for this feature

#### Sub-tasks:

- [x] 0.1: Review existing Document Types implementation
  - Validation: Confirmed all Document Types files exist and are properly structured
  - Output: Document Types is fully implemented with dialog-based form (not separate page)

- [x] 0.2: Review sidebar menu structure in app-sidebar.tsx
  - Validation: Identified that "Documents" menu item is missing from the "Document Management" section
  - Output: Sidebar has "Document Management" section with "Document Types" and "Document Templates" but missing "Documents"

- [x] 0.3: Review Documents page implementation
  - Validation: Documents page exists at `/documents/page.tsx` and uses DocumentsTable component
  - Output: Page exists and should be accessible via route, just not linked in sidebar

- [x] 0.4: Identify file patterns from existing implementations
  - Validation: Reviewed companies-table.tsx and main-processes-table.tsx for patterns
  - Output: Tables follow consistent pattern: DataGrid with TanStack Table, row selection, filters, bulk actions, responsive design

#### Quality Checklist:

- [x] PRD structure reviewed and understood
- [x] File locations determined and aligned with project conventions
- [x] Naming conventions identified (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)
- [x] Existing patterns identified for replication

### 1. Fix Documents Page Missing from Sidebar Menu

**Objective**: Add the "Documents" menu item to the "Document Management" section in the sidebar

#### Sub-tasks:

- [x] 1.1: Add Documents menu item to app-sidebar.tsx
  - File: `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/components/app-sidebar.tsx`
  - Location: Inside the "Document Management" section (line 108-122), add new item for "Documents"
  - Validation: Menu item appears in sidebar between "Document Types" and "Document Templates"
  - Code pattern to follow:
    ```typescript
    {
      title: t('documents'),
      url: "/documents",
    }
    ```

#### Quality Checklist:

- [ ] Menu item added to correct section (Document Management)
- [ ] Translation key matches existing pattern (uses 'documents' from Navigation namespace)
- [ ] URL path is correct ("/documents")
- [ ] Menu item appears in correct alphabetical/logical order
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Sidebar renders correctly with new menu item
- [ ] Clicking menu item navigates to /documents page

### 2. Review and Enhance Document Types Table Implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Important Technical Considerations:

1. **Document Types vs Documents Distinction**:
   - **documentTypes**: Lookup table defining types of documents (e.g., "Passport", "Work Contract")
   - **documents**: Actual document records uploaded by users
   - Both exist in schema and have separate CRUD operations

2. **Sidebar Menu Structure**:
   - "Document Management" section currently has:
     - Document Types (line 114-116)
     - Document Templates (line 117-120)
   - Missing: Documents entry (should be added around line 113)

3. **Table Component Patterns to Follow**:
   - Use `createSelectColumn<T>()` for selection checkbox
   - Use `DataGridHighlightedCell` for primary text columns
   - Use `DataGridColumnHeader` for sortable headers
   - Use `DataGridRowActions` for row-level actions
   - Use `DataGridBulkActions` for bulk operations
   - Use `DataGridFilter` for global search
   - Use `DataGridColumnVisibility` for column toggles
   - Use `ScrollArea` with `ScrollBar` for horizontal scroll
   - Use `globalFuzzyFilter` for search functionality

4. **Responsive Design Pattern**:
   ```tsx
   <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row justify-between items-stretch sm:items-center gap-2">
     <DataGridFilter table={table} className="w-full sm:max-w-sm" />
     <DataGridColumnVisibility
       table={table}
       trigger={<Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="w-full sm:w-auto">Columns</Button>}
     />
   </div>
   ```

5. **Breadcrumb Pattern**:
   - Always use `tBreadcrumbs` for translations
   - Structure: `[{ label: tBreadcrumbs('dashboard'), href: "/dashboard" }, ...]`
   - Document Types shows under "Support Data" section in breadcrumbs
   - Documents shows directly under "Dashboard" in breadcrumbs

6. **Form Implementation**:
   - Document Types uses dialog-based form (DocumentTypeFormDialog)
   - Documents may use page-based form (check `/documents/new/page.tsx`)
   - Both patterns are acceptable based on UX requirements

### Architectural Decisions:

1. **Why Document Types uses Dialog Form**:
   - Simple form with few fields
   - Quick create/edit workflow
   - Keeps user in table context

2. **Why some pages use separate form pages**:
   - Complex forms with multiple sections
   - File uploads or rich interactions
   - Better for larger data entry tasks

3. **Data Grid Choice**:
   - Project uses custom DataGrid components built on TanStack Table
   - Provides consistent UX across all tables
   - Highly customizable and performant
