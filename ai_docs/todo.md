# TODO: Implement Dedicated Creation Pages for Non-Support Data Entities

## âœ… ALL TASKS COMPLETED

All 6 modules have been successfully converted to use dedicated creation pages instead of modals. Portuguese translations have also been added for all new keys.

## Context

Currently, all pages in the application use modal dialogs for creating new items. However, per the new requirement, only pages under the "Support Data" menu should continue using modals. All other pages (People & Companies section, Documents, Tasks, Process Management) should navigate to dedicated creation pages instead.

This change improves the user experience for complex forms by providing more screen real estate and a clearer workflow separation.

## Related PRD Sections

- Section 3.2: Core Modules - Identifies the different modules in the system
- Section 10.1: User Roles and Permissions - Understanding access patterns
- Section 11: Project folder structure and component patterns

## Current State Analysis

### Support Data Pages (KEEP MODALS):
Located under the "Support Data" menu in sidebar (lines 120-157 of app-sidebar.tsx):
- Countries (`/countries`)
- States (`/states`)
- Cities (`/cities`)
- Process Types (`/process-types`)
- Legal Frameworks (`/legal-frameworks`)
- CBO Codes (`/cbo-codes`)
- Consulates (`/consulates`)
- Document Types (`/document-types`)

### Pages That Need Dedicated Creation Pages (CHANGE TO PAGES):

**People & Companies Section:**
- People (`/people`)
- Companies (`/companies`)
- Passports (`/passports`)
- People-Companies (`/people-companies`)

**Other Sections:**
- Documents (`/documents`)
- Tasks (`/tasks`)
- Process Requests (`/process-requests`)
- Main Processes (`/main-processes`)
- Individual Processes (`/individual-processes`)

## Task Sequence

### 0. Project Structure Analysis (ALWAYS FIRST)

## Implementation Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions:

1. **Routing Pattern**: Use `/[entity-name]/new/page.tsx` for all creation pages
2. **Form Reuse**: Keep dialog forms for editing, create separate page components for creation
3. **Breadcrumb Structure**: Always include Dashboard > Section > Entity > Action
4. **Navigation**: Use Next.js router for navigation, not modal state
5. **Success Handling**: Redirect to list page after successful creation with toast notification

### File Structure Pattern:

```
app/[locale]/(dashboard)/[entity-name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # List page (updated to navigate instead of modal)
â”œâ”€â”€ new/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx               # Creation page (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ [id]/
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx               # Detail page (future)

components/[entity-name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ [entity]-form-dialog.tsx   # Keep for editing (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ [entity]-form-page.tsx     # Page wrapper for creation form (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ [entity]-table.tsx         # Table component (existing)
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

1. Don't duplicate form validation logic - share Zod schemas
2. Don't forget to update both English and Portuguese translations
3. Don't skip mobile testing - many users may access on mobile
4. Don't forget proper error handling and loading states
5. Don't neglect breadcrumb navigation - it's crucial for UX
6. Don't forget to remove the creation modal state from list pages
