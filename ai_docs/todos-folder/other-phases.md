Based on my thorough analysis of the PRD, Phase 2 completion, current schema, and
existing code, here's a comprehensive task list of what's missing to finish the app:

ðŸ“Š Analysis Summary

What's Already Complete:

- âœ… All database lookup tables and CRUD operations
- âœ… Companies, People, People-Companies management
- âœ… Passports and Documents basic CRUD
- âœ… Process Request workflow (client submit â†’ admin approve/reject)
- âœ… Document Templates system with auto-generation
- âœ… Document upload/review workflow with version control
- âœ… Individual Processes with document checklist
- âœ… Authentication & role-based access control (admin/client)
