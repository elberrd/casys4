# TODO: Complete Tasks Module Implementation

## Context

Based on PRD review and current implementation analysis, the Tasks module is **partially implemented**. The following components exist:

-  Backend: Full Convex schema and mutations/queries (convex/tasks.ts)
-  List page with tabs and statistics (app/[locale]/(dashboard)/tasks/page.tsx)
-  Table component with actions (components/tasks/tasks-table.tsx)
-  Form component for create/edit (components/tasks/task-form-page.tsx)
-  Create page routing (app/[locale]/(dashboard)/tasks/new/page.tsx)
-  Validation schema (lib/validations/tasks.ts)
-  Translation keys (messages/en.json and pt.json)

**Missing Features:**

- L Edit task page/functionality
- L View task detail dialog/page
- L Reassign task dialog
- L Extend deadline dialog
- L Task detail view with complete information
- L Status update functionality on the edit page

The user specifically mentioned they **cannot see a page to add a task**, but the new task page already exists at `/tasks/new`. However, the functionality needs to be verified and improved to match the professional style of other pages (like the people page).

## Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Considerations

1. **Reuse Existing Patterns**: The people module has excellent examples of:
   - Table implementation with DataGrid
   - Form pages with proper validation
   - Navigation and routing
   - Dialog patterns

2. **Backend Already Complete**: All Convex mutations and queries exist:
   - `tasks.create`, `tasks.update`, `tasks.remove`
   - `tasks.complete`, `tasks.reassign`, `tasks.extendDeadline`
   - `tasks.list`, `tasks.get`, `tasks.getMyTasks`

3. **Mobile-First Approach**:
   - Use Tailwind responsive breakpoints: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`
   - Test on mobile viewport first
   - Ensure touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)
   - Proper overflow and scrolling

4. **Component Reusability**:
   - Use existing DataGrid components
   - Use shadcn/ui Dialog, Card, Badge, Button
   - Follow established form patterns
   - Use Combobox for searchable selects

5. **Internationalization**:
   - All user-facing strings through `useTranslations`
   - Keys already exist in messages/en.json
   - Add Portuguese translations in messages/pt.json

6. **Type Safety**:
   - Use Convex-generated types from `@/convex/_generated/dataModel`
   - Define proper TypeScript interfaces for components
   - Use Zod for form validation

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Level**: Test each dialog and form component independently
2. **Integration Level**: Test workflows (create -> view -> edit -> complete)
3. **UI Level**: Test responsive design on different viewports
4. **Access Control**: Test admin vs client user permissions

### Design Consistency

Match the professional style of the people module:

- Clean card layouts
- Proper spacing and padding
- Consistent button placement
- Professional table styling with DataGrid
- Smooth navigation flows
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Definition of Done

- [x] All tasks can be created from the tasks list page
- [x] Task detail page shows complete information with professional layout
- [x] Tasks can be edited with pre-filled form
- [x] Tasks can be reassigned to different users
- [x] Task deadlines can be extended
- [x] Task status can be updated (including mark complete)
- [x] All pages are mobile responsive (sm, md, lg breakpoints)
- [x] All text is internationalized (English and Portuguese)
- [x] UI matches professional style of people module
- [x] No TypeScript errors or `any` types
- [x] All quality checklists passed
- [x] End-to-end workflows tested
- [x] Access control works correctly (admin/client)
- [x] Performance is acceptable (no lag or slowness)

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Considerations

1. **Real-time Updates**: Leverage Convex's reactive queries for notifications and dashboard widgets
2. **Performance**: Use proper indexing for activity logs to handle large datasets
3. **Access Control**: Enforce role-based filtering at the query level, not just in the UI
4. **Error Handling**: Activity logging should never break main operations - always wrapped in try-catch
5. **Data Retention**: Consider adding cleanup jobs for old notifications and activity logs (future enhancement)

### Technical Decisions

1. **Notification System**:
   - Use Convex subscriptions for real-time updates (no polling needed)
   - Notifications stored in database (not ephemeral like toast messages)
   - Entity links allow navigation to related records

2. **Dashboard**:
   - Start with fixed widget layout, add customization later if needed
   - Use server-side aggregation for statistics (efficient)
   - Separate admin and client views for better UX

3. **Activity Logs**:
   - Log at mutation level, not at database trigger level
   - Store details as flexible JSON to accommodate different entity types
   - Provide both global view (activity logs page) and entity-specific view (history tabs)

### Dependencies and Gotchas

1. **Task Order**:
   - Schema changes must be completed before backend implementation
   - Backend queries/mutations must exist before frontend integration
   - Translations should be added before testing UI

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Notification triggers require updates to existing mutations
   - Activity logging requires updates to ALL mutations across multiple files
   - Dashboard widgets depend on multiple data sources

3. **Testing Considerations**:
   - Test notification delivery for all event types
   - Verify access control for admin vs client users on dashboard
   - Ensure activity logs capture all required details
   - Test export functionality with large datasets

# TODO: Phase 5 - Bulk Operations & Productivity + Government Protocol Tracking

## Context

This phase implements two major feature groups for the immigration process management system:

1. **Bulk Operations** - Efficiency improvements for managing multiple people, processes, documents, and tasks simultaneously
2. **Government Protocol Tracking** - Specific UI for tracking government submission data (MRE, DOU, Protocol, RNM, Appointments)

Both features are essential for improving productivity and providing comprehensive tracking of the immigration workflow.

## Related PRD Sections

- Section 5.3: Status Tracking (Bulk operations for common actions)
- Section 4.2: individual_processes table (Government protocol fields already exist in schema)
- Section 10.3: Document Template Management (Document operations)
- Section 5.4: Task Automation (Task assignment)

## Project Structure Notes

Based on PRD analysis:

- **Backend**: Convex functions in `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/convex/`
- **Frontend Pages**: `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/[module-name]/`
- **Components**: `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/components/[module-name]/`
- **Validation Schemas**: `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/lib/validations/`
- **Utilities**: `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/lib/utils/` and `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/lib/constants/`
- **Translations**: `/Users/elberrd/Documents/Development/clientes/casys4/messages/en.json` and `pt.json`

Existing patterns observed:

- Data grid components use TanStack table with bulk selection
- Form dialogs use shadcn/ui components with Zod validation
- Convex mutations require admin role via `requireAdmin(ctx)`
- Activity logging is done via scheduler with `internal.activityLogs.logActivity`

## Task Sequence

## Implementation Notes

### Key Dependencies

1. **CSV Import**: JSZip or similar for file handling
2. **Bulk Download**: JSZip for client-side zip generation
3. **Date/DateTime Pickers**: shadcn/ui date components
4. **Multi-select**: Existing multi-select component in `/components/ui/`

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Bulk Operations Transaction Safety**: Use Convex transactions where possible, implement rollback logic for failures
2. **CSV Format**: Standard CSV with UTF-8 encoding, first row headers, Excel-compatible
3. **Government Status Calculation**: Client-side logic, not stored in database (calculated on read)
4. **Appointment Reminders**: Convex scheduled functions running daily at midnight UTC
5. **Protocol Verification**: Manual for now, placeholder for future API integration

### Performance Considerations

1. **Bulk Operations**: Process in batches of 10-20 to avoid timeouts
2. **Export**: Use pagination for large datasets, stream to CSV
3. **Document Download**: Generate zip client-side to reduce server load
4. **Appointment Countdown**: Update every minute, not real-time seconds

### Security Considerations

1. **CSV Upload**: Validate and sanitize all imported data
2. **Bulk Delete**: Require admin role and confirmation
3. **Document Download**: Verify user has access to all requested documents
4. **Export**: Filter by user's company for client role

### Future Enhancements

1. **Government API Integration**: Replace manual protocol verification with API calls
2. **Calendar Integration**: Sync appointments to Google Calendar, Outlook
3. **Email Notifications**: Send email for appointment reminders
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Recurring appointments, appointment types
5. **Bulk Operation History**: Track and replay previous bulk operations

## Estimated Effort

- **Backend (Tasks 1-4, 15)**: 3-4 days
- **Frontend Components (Tasks 5-10)**: 5-6 days
- **Government Protocol Tracking (Tasks 11-16)**: 3-4 days
- **Integration Testing (Task 17)**: 2 days
- **Documentation (Task 18)**: 1 day

**Total Estimated Effort**: 14-17 development days (approximately 3-4 weeks for one developer)

## Risk Factors

1. **CSV Parsing Complexity**: Various CSV formats and encodings may cause issues
   - Mitigation: Provide strict template, validate rigorously

2. **Bulk Operation Performance**: Large datasets may cause timeouts
   - Mitigation: Implement batching and progress indicators

3. **Government Field Requirements**: May vary by process type or legal framework
   - Mitigation: Start with current schema fields, expand as needed

4. **Mobile Datetime Pickers**: Native datetime pickers vary by browser
   - Mitigation: Use well-tested shadcn/ui components, fallback to separate date/time

5. **Notification Overload**: Too many bulk operations may spam notifications
   - Mitigation: Batch notifications, add user preferences for notification types
