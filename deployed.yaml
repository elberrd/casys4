lessons_learned:
  - "CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY must be set for ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development) in Vercel"
  - "After adding/updating environment variables in Vercel, MUST click 'Redeploy' button"
  - "Build command must be overridden in Vercel Project Settings â†’ General â†’ Build & Development Settings"
  - "Environment variables added via CLI may not work correctly - use Vercel dashboard for reliability"
  - "Vercel needs environment variables to be explicitly set for build phase access"

notes: |
  ðŸŽ‰ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!
  
  âœ… Vercel project: https://casys4.vercel.app
  âœ… Convex production: https://pleasant-mosquito-546.convex.cloud
  âœ… Auto-deploy enabled: Push to main branch triggers deployment
  âœ… Environment variables configured and working
  âœ… Build command configured with Convex integration
  
  DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW NOW ACTIVE:
  1. Push to main branch
  2. Vercel automatically triggers build
  3. Convex functions deploy first
  4. Next.js app builds with production Convex URL
  5. Site deploys to production
  
  All future deployments will be automatic via GitHub push!
